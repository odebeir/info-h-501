# About
This is the new version of the *INFO-H-501 Pattern recognition and image analysis* lecture form the EPB/ULB.

The course is divided into two part :

* machine learning part by Pr C. Deacaestecker
* pattern recognition by Pr O. Debeir

This repository concerns only the pattern recognition / image analysis part
 
The main idea is to gather lecture content and example code in one single repository. 
Student are invited to scrutinize the code examples to reproduce them and/or dectect probable mistakes.

This repository is a work in progress, so part of the material consists in previous pdf files of the lectures.
